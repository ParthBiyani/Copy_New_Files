# Copy_New_Files

The .bat file was created to copy all the new files from a specific source folder to a specified target folder.<br><br>
This is basically a very fast automated backup system that will backup the files from the specified folder to (ideally) an external or additional storage device. The program will only copy files that are newly created or have date modified newer than previously present on the target location. It does not delete files in the target location even if they have been deleted at the source location.<br>
The ideal case to use this program will be by putting it in the startup folder of windows so that it is executed everytime the PC is turned on. This will automate the task of taking backup.
